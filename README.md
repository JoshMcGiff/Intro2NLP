Practical content for my lecture: "Introduction to Natural Language Processing"

"Congratulations!! ðŸ¥³ You have been hired by your favourite game development company to produce the sequel to your favourite game. 

Your first task at the company is to perform a complete analysis of Steam reviews for the existing game. ðŸ”Ž

Split into pairs to perform this analysis. You should investigate what contributed to the positive reviews and what elements of the game contributed to the negative reviews. Try to find trends in the data that should influence the sequel."
